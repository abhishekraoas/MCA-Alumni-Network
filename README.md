## Important Instructions

- Before any updation in the code of your editor you must have to first use "git pull" command for the code updation or syncing.
- Backend is already done. You have to only design the Modern UI of this project. You don't need to do the backend.
- You can use any UI library or framework you want.
- Please make sure the UI is responsive and looks good on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js (JavaScript framework)
  - Tailwind CSS (for responsive and customizable UI)
  - Material-UI (for component styling)
- **Backend**:

  - Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
  - Express.js (Node.js framework)
  - MongoDB (Database)

- **Authentication**:

  - JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication.
  - OAuth2 for third-party login (Google, LinkedIn).

- **Deployment**:
  - Vercel for frontend deployment.
  - Heroku for backend deployment.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (local or cloud)
- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishekraoas/MCA-Alumni-Network.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd MCA-Alumni-Network
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start MongoDB server:**

   - If you are using a local MongoDB instance, make sure your MongoDB server is running:
     ```bash
     mongod
     ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**

   - In the backend folder, create a `.env` file and add the following:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     URL_DB=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
     SECRET_KEY=<your_jwt_secret>
     ```

3. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Start the frontend development server:**

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`, and the backend at `http://localhost:3000`.
